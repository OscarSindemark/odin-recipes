    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pepparkakor are thin, crispy, gingerbread cookies that are a Christmas tradition in Sweden. They're usually cut into heart, flower, or star shapes. Store cooled cookies in airtight containers.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Flour:</strong> This pepparkakor recipe starts with all-purpose flour, which gives the cookies structure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Baking soda:</strong> Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spices:</strong> These cozy pepparkakor cookies are spiced with cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and cardamom.</li>
                    <li><strong>Butter:</strong> Two sticks of butter add moisture and richness.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> A blend of white and brown sugars gives these cookies a perfectly balanced sweet flavor.</li>
                    <li><strong>Egg:</strong> A beaten egg adds moisture and acts as a binder, which means it helps hold the dough together.</li>
                    <li><strong>Corn syrup:</strong> Dark corn syrup adds even more moisture and sweetness. If you'd like a lighter flavor, opt for light corn syrup.</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Make the dough:</strong> Sift the dry ingredients together. Beat the butter and sugars, then add the remaining ingredients. Add the dry mix to the wet mix, then chill the dough.</li>
                    <li><strong>Roll and cut the dough:</strong> Roll the chilled dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Cut the dough into shapes using cookie cutters.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bake the cookies:</strong> Bake the cookies in a preheated oven until they're set. Transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool.</li> 
                </ol>
